class PluginRegistry(object):
    """A plugin registry

    Custodian is intended to be innately pluggable both internally and
    externally, for resource types and their filters and actions.

    This plugin registry abstraction provides the core mechanism for
    that. Its a simple string to class map, with python package
    entry_point loading for external plugins.

    As an example of defining an external plugin using a python package

    .. code-block:: python

       setup(
           name="custodian_cmdb",
           description="Custodian filters for interacting with internal CMDB"

                     'custodian.ec2.filters = custodian_cmdb:filter_ec2']},
           )

    For loading the plugins we can simply invoke method:load_plugins like
    so::

      PluginRegistry('ec2.filters').load_plugins()
